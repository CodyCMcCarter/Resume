        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>
            I am a 33 year old husband and father. I love my family and highly value my time with them. 
            I love getting down on the floor and playing with my 2 year old son. 
            I also love relaxing and cuddling up with my wife to watch shows on various streaming services. 
            I enjoy playing games with friends online, currently Helldivers 2 more often than not.
